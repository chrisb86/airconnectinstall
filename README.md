airconnectinstall installs AirConnect on a FreeBSD system. It takes care of downloading the binary, creates a user and an startup script.

Just copy the script to a FreeBSD machine and run it.

AirConnect is a binary written in go that enables AirPlay for UPnP devices that don't support AirPlay. This setup is tuned for older SONOS devices.
